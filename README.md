## Getting and Cleaning Data - Coursera Project

The current repository contains a R script named run_analysis.R and a codebook.md file describing the output file generated by the script.

The script is designed to be saved in the current working directory. It can be run as long as the Samsung data, i.e. the content of the folder 'UCI HAR Dataset' is in the current working directory. 

No specific package is required except the 'dplyr' library. Make sure it has been installed using the install.packages command before runnning the script.
